      Da Shpoof is an impromptu public speaking session which aims to help and improve the general public speaking skills of our members here at Speakeasy. Da Shpoof takes place on a fortnightly basis and is one of our flagship events that takes place right throughout the college calendar year. How does it work? Each individual is given a topic at random and has 90 seconds to give the best presentation possible on that topic. The aim of the game is to bluff your way into convincing the audience that you know what you're talking about. This event provides the perfect setting for those who are either completely new to public speaking, or even just looking to brush up on their skills in an informal, relaxed and judgement-free environment.
